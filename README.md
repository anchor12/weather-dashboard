# Weather Dashboard

## Summary
This dashboard allows the user to search for a city which calls the OpenWeather API to get the weather for the day plus the 5 day weather forecast for that city. When the user searches for a city, a button appears below the searchbar which can be clicked on to call the weather for that city again. The users searches are also stored in Local Storage in their browser so that when the user revisits the dashboard, their previous searches are saved as buttons in the frontend.
